Dear Julia,
You are the most beautiful girl that I have ever seen. I was wondering if you would like to come and visit me. My mother will make us pancakes with ice cream. My dog, Bella, just had three beautiful puppies. Mom says I may only keep one of them. I would like you to help me choose one, because they are all so cute and adorable. And just because you are my special friend, you may also have one if you want.
Your friend,
Hector.
