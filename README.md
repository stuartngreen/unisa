Programming practice and projects created for BSc. in Computing at Unisa. Module descriptions are from [unisa.ac.za](https://www.unisa.ac.za).

##### **[asm]**
**COS2621 - Computer Organisation**<br>
_Purpose:_ To introduce students to the underlying structure of a modern digital computer, including digital logic level, machine code level and the software system level. It involves programming in an assembly language.

##### **[C++]**
###### _Beginner_
**COS1511 - Introduction to Programming I**<br>
_Purpose:_ To provide students with an introduction to programming and to cover the fundamentals of control structures, problem-solving techniques, and the incremental testing of programs.

**COS1512 - Introduction to Programming II**<br>
_Purpose:_ To introduce students to the detailed design and implementation of algorithms as programs, and includes the fundamentals of simple data structures with object-orientation.
###### _Intermediate_
**COS2611 - Data Structures**<br>
_Purpose:_ To show learners how abstract data types and data structures can be implemented and used in an object-oriented programming language. The module covers recursion, linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, binary trees, and graphs.

**COS2614 - Contemporary Concepts**<br>
_Purpose:_ To enable students to understand and apply the principles of object-orientated programming (inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism). Students are also introduced to the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and required to apply it when designing solutions to problems introduced in the course. Students are also taught the principles of graphical user interface (GUI) programming, design patterns, and how to apply them when designing and implementing contemporary software systems.
###### _Advanced_
**COS3711 - Advanced Programming**<br>
_Purpose:_ To increase the depth of student's insight into advanced programming principles and consolidate their competence there-in.

##### **[SQL]**
**INF3703 - Databases II**<br>
_Purpose:_ To introduce students to the fundamentals of databases and database management systems covering both single and distributed database systems, relational and object-oriented databases, and dealing with aspects such as normalisation, entity-relationship modelling, transaction management and concurrency control, data warehousing, and database administration.

##### **[WebGL]**
**COS3712 - Computer Graphics**<br>
_Purpose:_ To enable a student to understand and apply the basic principles and techniques of modern computer graphics. You can view my assignment project [here](https://stuartngreen.github.io/unisa/webgl-room-scene/).
